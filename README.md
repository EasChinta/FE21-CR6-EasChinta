# FE21-CR6-EasChinta

Hello and welcome to my last Front-End Code Review.

This time it was a bit easier to accomplish the tasks, but I still
need a lot more knowledge to implement cool ideas that I have and I would like to implent in my projects. 

I have managed to complete all the tasks as requested in the CR6 description and all the routing works fine. 


There's not really much I could say about this project, since it was fairly managable and not as difficult as one of the previous ones (at least for me) and everything went kinda smoothly. 

Thank you for your time. 

I wish you a nice Weekend! 


Kind regards,


Eas Chinta
